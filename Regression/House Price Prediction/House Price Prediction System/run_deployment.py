Before running this file please follow the below instructions

Install ZenML - https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/installation 

Once you download source code, create a virtual env, follow this guide to create virtual environment: https://youtu.be/GZbeL5AcTgw?si=uj7B8-10kbyEytKo 

Once virtualenv environment is activated, run following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you are running the run_deployment.py script, you will also need to install some integrations using ZenML:

zenml integration install mlflow -y 

The project can only be executed with a ZenML stack that has an MLflow experiment tracker and model deployer as a component. Configuring a new stack with the two components are as follows:

zenml integration install mlflow -y
zenml experiment-tracker register mlflow_tracker --flavor=mlflow
zenml model-deployer register mlflow --flavor=mlflow
zenml stack register local-mlflow-stack -a default -o default -d mlflow -e mlflow_tracker --set
